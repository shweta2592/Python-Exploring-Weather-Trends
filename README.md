# Python-Exploring-Weather-Trends

<h2>Exploring Weather Trends - Project Instructions </h2
 <br> <h4>Tools Used: SQL, Python </h4>
<h4>Summary</h4>
This project was a part of Udacity Nanodegree Data Analyst program where I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends of Singapore with global temperature trends.
<br>My goal was to create visualizations and listing my observations.
Some of the questions addressed were:
<br>
<li>Observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Singapore's averages, as well as overall trends. 
<li>Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
<li>“How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
<li>What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
